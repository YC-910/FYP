This repository contains my Final Year Project (FYP), which focuses on healthcare data analysis and a web-based healthcare portal. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model training, and a user-friendly web interface for viewing hospital, department, patient, and predictive information. Python is used for data analysis and backend processing, while HTML is used to build the portal interface, aiming to support better healthcare insights and decision-making.
